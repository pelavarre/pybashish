# Let's say we need you to start speaking Python as fluently as I do

# How do I set you up?
# Well you be you, we'll have to tune this for you ... but many of you already know Bash
# Not all of Bash, just enough Bash to get your job done

# I can rewrite just those bits into Python, set you up to copy-edit
# Like our own Stack Overflow for Python, but executable, small, focused on us

[a]  export PS1='\$ '

[b]  git clone https://github.com/pelavarre/pybashish.git
[c]  cd pybashish/

[d]  cat README.md
[e]  git branch -a
[f]  git checkout main  # unneeded if new clone
[g]  git ls-files |column

# Want to know how we print hostnames? Fully qualified and not? Take a look

[h]  less bin/hostname.py

# If you know some Python already, then you know it's not ordinarily this simple
# It can only be this simple if we bring in bots to spell out the boring parts of Python for us
# Let's show you the bots

:q

[i]  bin/argdoc.py --rip argdoc bin/hostname.py

# You saw how that source file began with little more than its own help lines

# That's all you really need ... we can tell the bots to show us the code they write for you

[j]  bin/argdoc.py --rip argparse bin/hostname.py

# These bots make it affordable for you to make more of these bots ... that's the win

[k]  cd bin/
[l]  argdoc.py --rip argdoc hostname.py >p.py
[m]  chmod +x p.py
[n]  vim p.py

[o]  cat p.py
